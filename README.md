# Assorted-Cards-images
A card layout with various sizes, containing images and/or text followed by responsiveness using grid layout.
Key Css property:
display:contents
 causes an element's children to appear as if they were direct children of the element's parent, ignoring the element itself. This can be useful when a wrapper element should be ignored when using CSS grid or similar layout techniques.
